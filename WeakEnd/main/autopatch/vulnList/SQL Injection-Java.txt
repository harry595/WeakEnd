PATCH FAILED: Read below code and patch manually

In Spring,
Prepared Statement used by default
when making SQL query in mybatis, Use #{ } rather than ${ }. #{ } convert parameter to string.
example: " select * from  tblUserInfo where userid = '#{userid}' and userpw = '#{userpw}' "

In JSP,
Prepared Statement is not default, So write code like below.
PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement("select count(*) from member where userid=? and password=?");
stmt.setString(1, userid);
stmt.setString(2, password);
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();
