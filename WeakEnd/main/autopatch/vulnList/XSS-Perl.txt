PATCH FAILED: Read below and patch manually.

Make a blacklist about some special characters, 
Then delete those characters or substitute those characters with safe character.
Or get module from CPAN and use that to escape string

Example:
    $text =~ s/[^A-Za-z0-9 ]*/ /g;
OR
    use Apache::Util;
    use Apache::Request;
    my $apr = Apache::Request->new(Apache->request);
    my $text = $apr->param('text');
    $r->content_type("text/html");
    $r->send_http_header;
    $r->print("You entered ", Apache::Util::html_encode($text));
