PATCH FAILED: Read below and patch manually.

In Django,
Django Template escape specific characters which ar particularly dangerous to HTML.
But if you use safe template tag like below
{{ text | safe }}
And use autoescape off like below, It doesn't escape string.
{% autoescape off %}
    {{ text }}
{% endautoescape %}
It will cause XSS, So don't use safe tag or autoescape off/false when you display user's input

In Flask,
If you want to display user's input on web, Use render_template(), NOT render_template_string()
