# BAD EXAMPLES. DON'T DO THIS!
cursor.execute("SELECT admin FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + '");
cursor.execute("SELECT admin FROM users WHERE username = '%s' % username);
cursor.execute("SELECT admin FROM users WHERE username = '{}'".format(username));
cursor.execute(f"SELECT admin FROM users WHERE username = '{username}'");

Each of these statements passes username from the client directly to the database, without performing any sort of check or validation.

# SAFE EXAMPLES. DO THIS!
cursor.execute("SELECT admin FROM users WHERE username = %s'", (username, ));
cursor.execute("SELECT admin FROM users WHERE username = %(username)s", {'username': username});
In these statements, username is passed as a named parameter. Now, the database will use the specified type and value of username when executing the query, offering protection from Python SQL injection.
